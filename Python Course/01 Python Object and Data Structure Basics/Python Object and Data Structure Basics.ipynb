       "\"WEBVTT\\n\\n00:05.360 --> 00:09.740\\nWelcome back everyone to this section on Python object and data structure basics.\\n\\n00:10.960 --> 00:14.860\\nSo in this section of the course, we're going to start off by discussing basic data types.\\n\\n00:15.480 --> 00:19.650\\nAnd these are your basic building blocks of code when constructing larger pieces of code.\\n\\n00:19.800 --> 00:23.490\\nAnd we're going to quickly discuss all the possible data types that we're going to talk about in this\\n\\n00:23.490 --> 00:24.120\\nsection.\\n\\n00:24.120 --> 00:27.960\\nAnd then we'll have lectures that go into a lot more detail about each one.\\n\\n00:27.960 --> 00:30.770\\nSo don't worry about memorizing all the information shown here.\\n\\n00:30.780 --> 00:34.830\\nThis is more just a quick overview, and there's going to be a lecture on each of these data types as\\n\\n00:34.830 --> 00:36.330\\nwe go on throughout this section.\\n\\n00:37.820 --> 00:42.530\\nSo the data types that we're going to be discussing are the following in this table here we have the\\n\\n00:42.530 --> 00:46.100\\nname of the data type on that left hand column, and then there's the type.\\n\\n00:46.100 --> 00:52.040\\nSo what that means is just Python has an internal keyword for this name and you're not going to get\\n\\n00:52.040 --> 00:53.440\\nthe whole word integer.\\n\\n00:53.450 --> 00:56.810\\nThe whole word floating point instead of Python has kind of a shortened keyword.\\n\\n00:56.810 --> 01:02.000\\nSo that's the second column such as int for integer, STR, for strings, etc..\\n\\n01:02.670 --> 01:06.870\\nThen we have the description column, and that's just going to be what the actual description of the\\n\\n01:06.870 --> 01:07.500\\ndata type is.\\n\\n01:07.500 --> 01:08.970\\nSo let's quickly go through these.\\n\\n01:09.120 --> 01:14.350\\nWe start off with integers and those are just basic whole numbers such as three, 300, 200.\\n\\n01:14.370 --> 01:20.840\\nThen we have floating point numbers and those are numbers of a decimal point, 2.3, 4.6, 100.0.\\n\\n01:20.850 --> 01:25.930\\nAnd notice here that if even if you have 100.0, that still counts as a floating point number.\\n\\n01:25.950 --> 01:28.560\\nThat's no longer an integer because it has a decimal point.\\n\\n01:28.860 --> 01:33.950\\nThen after that, we have strings, and strings are an ordered sequence of characters.\\n\\n01:33.960 --> 01:39.090\\nYou can think of these as just kind of words, but you should also note they can be numbers as well\\n\\n01:39.090 --> 01:41.640\\nas foreign characters inside of a string.\\n\\n01:41.670 --> 01:46.330\\nThe main thing that the notes is a string is that it either has double quotes or single quotes.\\n\\n01:46.350 --> 01:49.800\\nHere we can see we have hello and double quotes Sammy and single quotes.\\n\\n01:49.800 --> 01:54.450\\nWe have the digits of 2000 inside double quotes that makes it a string.\\n\\n01:54.450 --> 01:57.480\\nIt's no longer just an integer because it has double quotes around it.\\n\\n01:57.480 --> 02:00.960\\nAnd then you can also see we have some Japanese characters inside double quotes.\\n\\n02:01.470 --> 02:08.130\\nThen we come to data structures, and data structures are a little more specialized in basic data types\\n\\n02:08.130 --> 02:14.310\\nand data objects because they can actually hold data objects in some sort of sequence or in some sort\\n\\n02:14.310 --> 02:15.270\\nof mapping.\\n\\n02:15.900 --> 02:19.500\\nSo here we have lists and these are an ordered sequence of objects.\\n\\n02:19.500 --> 02:24.660\\nHere we can see that we've been able to use square brackets and commas to have a sequence of other objects,\\n\\n02:24.660 --> 02:26.910\\nsuch as the number ten, the string.\\n\\n02:26.910 --> 02:27.360\\nHello.\\n\\n02:27.360 --> 02:29.220\\nAnd then the number of 200.3.\\n\\n02:30.090 --> 02:34.030\\nDictionaries are another data structure that can store other data types.\\n\\n02:34.050 --> 02:39.060\\nExcept in this case, instead of having an ordered sequence, they have unordered key value pairs.\\n\\n02:39.060 --> 02:42.540\\nAnd we'll be discussing in a lot more detail how dictionaries work.\\n\\n02:42.540 --> 02:48.360\\nBut here we can see that we have a key, then a colon and then a value, and it's denoted by curly braces\\n\\n02:48.360 --> 02:53.520\\nas far as if it's a dictionary, instead of just being a normal list which has square brackets, but\\n\\n02:53.520 --> 02:58.350\\nthen we can have something like name and then colon, and then the value of that name is Frankie.\\n\\n02:59.010 --> 03:01.470\\nAgain, we'll be discussing dictionaries in a lot more detail.\\n\\n03:01.980 --> 03:03.720\\nAfter dictionaries, we have tuples.\\n\\n03:03.720 --> 03:08.280\\nSometimes they're also called tuples, and these are ordered immutable sequences of objects.\\n\\n03:08.280 --> 03:13.110\\nThey look a lot like lists, except they have parentheses and they're immutable, meaning you cannot\\n\\n03:13.110 --> 03:15.870\\nchange an object that's already in that sequence.\\n\\n03:15.870 --> 03:18.750\\nSo we'll be discussing what immutable means in a lot more detail.\\n\\n03:18.750 --> 03:20.130\\nWhen discussing tuples.\\n\\n03:20.610 --> 03:25.710\\nThen we have sets which are an unordered collection of unique objects, and again, we'll talk about\\n\\n03:25.710 --> 03:26.910\\nthat in a lot more detail.\\n\\n03:26.910 --> 03:29.760\\nThey're a little similar to a dictionary, but they don't have key value pairs.\\n\\n03:29.760 --> 03:33.000\\nInstead, they're just unique objects in some unordered collection.\\n\\n03:33.000 --> 03:34.770\\nSo you don't have that colon key value pair.\\n\\n03:35.040 --> 03:37.260\\nAgain, we'll discuss it in more detail later on.\\n\\n03:37.350 --> 03:42.810\\nThen finally we'll talk about booleans, which are just logical value values indicating true or false.\\n\\n03:42.840 --> 03:46.980\\nNotice how we have capital T in capital F, that sort of syntax is necessary for Python.\\n\\n03:47.130 --> 03:48.660\\nSo those are all the basic data types.\\n\\n03:48.660 --> 03:53.190\\nAgain, don't worry if you didn't understand any of this or didn't want to memorize any of this, we're\\n\\n03:53.190 --> 03:57.060\\ngoing to have a lecture on basically each of these topics in a lot more detail and show you how you\\n\\n03:57.060 --> 03:58.620\\ncan use them to write your own code.\\n\\n03:59.400 --> 03:59.780\\nOkay.\\n\\n03:59.790 --> 04:00.690\\nLet's get started.\\n\\n04:00.720 --> 04:01.980\\nI'll see you at the next lecture.\\n\""
