Notes on Generative AI

- Foundation Models(FM) : Pre-trained Deep learning models used for generative ai trained on very large amount of data

- Amazon Bedrock : foundation models service provider

- Prompt Engineering 

- Behind the working of FM like LLMs:
	-Token
	-Vectors
	-Embedding
	-Transformer Model


- Transform Architecture : DL models (Nueral Network) architecture which forms/process data together (parallelizable)
	-Encoder Only (M5 of Amazon used for amazon product search)
	-Encoder-Decoder 
	-Decoder Only

- Selection of FMs

- Feeding own data to FMs
- Ways to customize FMs
	-Reuse
	-Adapt
		-Retrival-Augmented Generation(RAG)
		-Model Customization
	-Build New

- Amazon SageMaker : Service used for model customization like RAG

- Amazon Q : AI Powered Assistant for Businesses and Developer

- Guardrails is the used to safeguard the input(prompt) and output(response) by removing unwanted things.
