- Foundation Models (FMs)
	- Meta and Google Open Source
	- OpenAI, Antropic, etc paid ones

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
	- FMs for text generation like chatgpt

- Diffusion Models are used for image based generation
	- Forward Diffusion in which model keep adding noise to image for understanding what is in image
	- Reverse Diffusion noise image with prompt keep own reducing noise and image is generated at last


-- Amazone Bedrock

- OpenAI's FMs are not available in Amazon Bedrock

- Bedrock create copy of the FMs which will just used by us

- We can fine tune those FMs just with our knowledge bases and data for specific responses

- Multimodel which take and produces varies type of input and output

- Amazons high performance FM is Amazone Titan

- Throughput : Number of tasks processed per second (higher is better).

- Latency : Time taken to process one task (lower is better).

- Parameters : Parameters are the learnable weights of a machine learning model. These values change during training as the model learns patterns in the data.

- Hyperparameters : A hyperparameter is a configuration setting chosen before training that affects how the model learns.

- Analogy: 
	If a neural network is a car, parameters (weights, biases) are like the engine components that run automatically, while hyperparameters are like the fuel type, tire pressure, or engine tuning that you set before driving.
	
	Hyperparameters = Cooking Recipe (set before cooking).
	Parameters = Taste (adjusted as you cook).


-- Fine Tuning

- Instruction Based : labeled examples of prompt-response pairs 
	Single Turn Messaging and Multi Turn Messaging are converstion based labeled data used for chatbot training

- Continued Pre-training : Use unlabeled data 

- RAG (Retrival Augment Generation)

- Vector DB services in AWS Aurora and OpenSearch Service


-- Prompt Engineering

- Enhanced Prompting : Providing enhanced prompt with all the information to the FMs
	- Instruction
	- Context
	- Input
	- Output

- Negative Prompting : we specify in prompt what we don't want as response(output).
	same as enhanced prompting but also include what you don't want in instruction and output.

- Zero Shot Prompting
- Few Shots Prompting
- One or Single Shot Prompting
- Chain of Thought Prompting
